> This used to be a GitHub Pages resume site at the very beginning of my web-development journey.
> Since then, I've gone on to make my own websites, my own designs, and I've come back to archive and unpublish this site finally.
> Assuming I maintain my websites & domains in the future, my new website(s) are hosted at [xevion.dev].
